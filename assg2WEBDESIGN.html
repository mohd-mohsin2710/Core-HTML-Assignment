<h1>Web Design.</h1>
<p>
Web design refers to the process of designing the visual appearance and
layout of websites. It involves creating a visual concept, planning the
layout of web pages, selecting color schemes, and choosing typography
and images.
<br />
Web designers use various tools and technologies to create visually
appealing and user-friendly websites. These tools include graphic design
software such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Sketch, and Figma.
They also use programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to
bring their designs to life on the web.
